# Car Web Client

React + TypeScript web app for the Car Marketplace. Provides pages for browsing car listings, viewing details, managing listings, orders, notifications, and profile (some pages currently use mock data).

## Tech Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Create React App (react-scripts)
- Testing Library + Jest

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Backend services (optional, for real API data):
- Car Listing Service
- Order Service  
- Notification Service

If these are not running, pages will fall back to existing mock flows where applicable.

## Available Scripts
- `npm start`: Run dev server
- `npm test`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run build`: Build production bundle to `build/`
- `npm run eject`: Eject CRA config (irreversible)

## Features
See `FEATURES.md` for a feature overview.

## API Integration Status
See `API_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` for details on which pages call real APIs vs. mock data.

## Project Structure
```

### API Endpoints & Data Models

**Car Listing Service**
- `GET /Car` - Get all cars
- `GET /Car/{id}` - Get car by ID
- `POST /Car` - Create new car listing
- `PUT /Car/{id}` - Update car listing
- `DELETE /Car/{id}` - Delete car listing

**Order Service**
- `GET /Order` - Get all orders
- `GET /Order/{id}` - Get order by ID
- `POST /Order` - Create new order
- `PUT /Order/{id}/status` - Update order status
- `DELETE /Order/{id}` - Delete order

**Notification Service**
- `GET /Notification` - Get all notifications
- `GET /Notification/{id}` - Get notification by ID
- `POST /Notification` - Create new notification
- `PUT /Notification/{id}/read` - Mark as read
- `DELETE /Notification/{id}` - Delete notification

### Data Models

**Car Model**
```json
{
  "id": "string (MongoDB ObjectId)",
  "brand": "string",
  "model": "string", 
  "year": "number",
  "mileage": "number",
  "condition": "string",
  "price": "decimal",
  "description": "string"
}
```

**Order Model**
```json
{
  "id": "Guid",
  "carId": "string",
  "buyerId": "string",
  "status": "string (pending|paid|cancelled)",
  "createdAt": "DateTime",
  "paidAt": "DateTime?",
  "amount": "decimal"
}
```

**Notification Model**
```json
{
  "id": "Guid",
  "userId": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "type": "string (email|push)",
  "createdAt": "DateTime",
  "isRead": "boolean"
}
```

### Service Responsibilities

- **Car Listing Service**: 
  - ‚úÖ Manages car listings (CRUD operations)
  - ‚ùå User authentication (not implemented yet)
  - ‚ùå User profiles (not implemented yet)
  - Uses MongoDB for data persistence
  - TODO: Implement RabbitMQ event publishing for 'car-listed' events

- **Order Service**: 
  - ‚úÖ Handles order creation, management, and order history
  - Uses in-memory storage (List<Order>)
  - TODO: Verify car status with car-listing-service
  - TODO: Implement RabbitMQ event publishing for 'order-created' and 'order-paid' events

- **Notification Service**: 
  - ‚úÖ Sends and manages user notifications
  - Uses in-memory storage (List<Notification>)
  - TODO: Listen to events from RabbitMQ and create notifications automatically

### Data Flow Pattern

1. **Partial API Integration**: Only car listings (GET operations) are fully integrated
2. **Service-Specific APIs**: Each service handles its domain-specific operations independently
3. **Mock Data Fallback**: Most features still use mock data while waiting for full API integration
4. **Future Event-Driven Architecture**: Services will communicate via RabbitMQ events (planned)
5. **Current State**: 
   - ‚úÖ Car browsing and details work with real backend
   - ‚ùå User management, orders, notifications use mock data
   - üîÑ Ready for incremental API integration as backend features are completed

    participant User
    participant WebClient as Car Web Client
    participant ListingService as Car Listing Service
    participant OrderService as Order Service
    participant NotificationService as Notification Service

    Note over User,NotificationService: 1. User Browses Cars
    User->>WebClient: View car listings
    WebClient->>ListingService: GET /Car
    ListingService-->>WebClient: List of available cars
    WebClient-->>User: Display car listings

    Note over User,NotificationService: 2. User Selects Car
    User->>WebClient: Click on car listing
    WebClient->>ListingService: GET /Car/{id}
    ListingService-->>WebClient: Car details (price, condition, etc.)
    WebClient-->>User: Show car details page

    Note over User,NotificationService: 3. User Initiates Purchase
    User->>WebClient: Click "Buy Now" button
    Note right of WebClient: Currently uses mock data<br/>TODO: Implement real order flow

    Note over User,NotificationService: 4. Order Creation (Future Implementation)
    WebClient->>OrderService: POST /Order
    Note right of OrderService: Order data: carId, buyerId, amount
    OrderService->>ListingService: Verify car availability
    ListingService-->>OrderService: Car status confirmation
    OrderService-->>WebClient: Order created (pending status)
    
    Note over User,NotificationService: 5. Notification Creation
    WebClient->>NotificationService: POST /Notification
    Note right of NotificationService: Notification: "Order placed successfully"
    NotificationService-->>WebClient: Notification created
    
    Note over User,NotificationService: 6. Order Confirmation
    WebClient-->>User: Order confirmation page
    Note right of WebClient: Show order ID, status, and next steps

    Note over User,NotificationService: 7. Order Management (Future)
    User->>WebClient: View order history
    WebClient->>OrderService: GET /Order
    OrderService-->>WebClient: User's orders
    WebClient-->>User: Display orders list

    Note over User,NotificationService: 8. Order Status Updates
    User->>WebClient: Check order status
    WebClient->>OrderService: GET /Order/{id}
    OrderService-->>WebClient: Current order status
    WebClient-->>User: Show updated status

    Note over User,NotificationService: 9. Payment Processing (Future)
    Note right of WebClient: Payment gateway integration<br/>TODO: Implement payment flow
    WebClient->>OrderService: PUT /Order/{id}/status
    Note right of OrderService: Update status to "paid"
    OrderService-->>WebClient: Status updated
    OrderService->>NotificationService: POST /Notification
    Note right of NotificationService: "Payment received" notification
    NotificationService-->>OrderService: Notification created
    WebClient-->>User: Payment confirmation
```

### Order Flow States

**Order Status Progression:**
1. **pending** - Order created, waiting for payment
2. **paid** - Payment received, order confirmed
3. **cancelled** - Order cancelled by user or system
4. **completed** - Order fulfilled and delivered

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Car Verification**: Order service validates car availability before creating order
- **Real-time Updates**: Order status changes trigger notifications
- **Payment Flow**: Future integration with payment gateway
- **Event Publishing**: RabbitMQ events for order lifecycle (planned)

## Environment Variables
No `.env` is required. If needed later, follow CRA conventions: variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_`.

## Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting
- App won‚Äôt load data: ensure backend services are running on the ports above
- Type errors after dependency changes: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Port conflict on 3000: set `PORT=3001 npm start`
